## About

This userscript adds sounds to both chat and other notifications on the official osu! websites.
For the foreseeable future, only the PC website version is supported.

Works on most browsers. You may need to enable "Developer Mode" in extension settings in case Manifest V3 is used (mostly chromium browsers for now).

## What does this extension do
- Plays sound, if notiffications counter increases
- There are two different sounds for chat and else
- You can set your sounds by editing links
